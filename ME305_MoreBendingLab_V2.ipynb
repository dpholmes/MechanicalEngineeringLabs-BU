    "We have designed remote labs keeping in mind the ABET 2020 standards of 21st century engineering. When conducting the lab work, we would like you to “function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives” while developing the “ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the following strategies to approach your lab group work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Cooperatively Collect Data**: As you work with your group, make sure ***that only one group member is conducting the experiment and collecting the data.*** This will allow your group to work together to troubleshoot, establish goals, plan out tasks, and interpret data results in collaboration together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   **Collaborate to Troubleshoot Experiments**: As you work with your group, think about ways to coordinate with your group members to innovate ways to troubleshoot experimental steps. Together you can develop the best way to achieve experimental outcomes, especially with steps that may be especially difficult.\n",

    "# Lab 3: More on Beam Bending\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been studying the shape of a bent beam through the lens of [Euler-Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler–Bernoulli_beam_theory) beam theory, which says that if the slope of a beam is small, its shape -- specifically, the vertical deflection v(x) -- can be described with the equation of an elastic curve:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "B \\frac{d^4v}{dx^4}=q(x),\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",

    "where $B = EI$ is the bending or flexural rigidity, $E$ is Young's elastic modulus, $I$ is the [second moment of area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area), and $q(x)$ is the distributed load acting transverse or orthogonal to the beam's neutral axis - it has units of force per unit length. I have assumed that $E$ and $I$ do not change along the $x$ axis of the beam. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, the equation (1) conveniently takes different forms depending on the order of the differential equation for v(x): \n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous lab we focused primarily on the deflection of a cantilevered beam under under various concentrated transverse loads. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory also describes forces and moments, and can therefore be used to study stresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transverse loading causes (1) bending moments, which lead to normal stresses which, in turn, cause strains through the beam's cross-section, and (2) shear forces, which lead to shear stresses, which cause [shear strains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_(physics)). Shear strain is deformation in which parallel surfaces (think layers of a beam or pages of a book) slide past one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most beams -- more specifically, those that are not too short or thick -- shear stresses are negligible compared to normal stresses. As such, shear effects are often neglected in analysis. Euler–Bernoulli beam theory does not account for the effects of transverse shear strain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll perform simple experiments to help visualize shear strains, and to try to grasp what's going on internally in a beam that resists these strains. We will also return to Euler-Bernoulli beam equation (the elastic curve) to see what it means to neglect shear in theoretical analysis."
